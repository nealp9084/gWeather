gWeather
========

A Ruby library and CLI for the Google Weather API (now defunct)

### Backstory

Eons ago, Google had this thing called iGoogle, which was like a customized homepage. Among one of the features offered by iGoogle was a weather display, backed by a secret weather API.

When Google got rid of iGoogle, it also got rid of the Google Weather API. This program got all of its data from that API, so this program is now useless.
